      # **Privacy Policy for Letter Boxed Solver**


      Effective Date: 02/10/2025


      ***


      ## **1. Your Privacy, Our Promise**


      At Letter Boxed Solver, we believe in transparency and simplicity. We
      build tools to help you enjoy solving puzzles, not to collect or monetize
      your personal data. Here's how we operate:


      * We do not ask for personal data (names, emails, accounts, etc.).

      * We do not store any data that can identify you.

      * We do not sell or share anything about you — with advertisers, partners,
      or anyone else.


      ***


      ## **2. What We Do During Your Session**


      When you use the tool, a few technical things may happen automatically,
      but always anonymously and temporarily:


      | **What
      happens**                                                                                  
      | **Purpose**                                           | **What we don’t
      do**                                                             |

      | Your browser sends your input (the letters you enter) to our server in
      order to compute a solution | To solve the puzzle and return the
      answer             | We don’t log or store your input after
      processing                                |

      | Standard server logs (IP, time stamp) as required by web server
      software                           | To maintain site operations,
      debugging, server health | These logs are not tied to your identity and
      are rotated or deleted periodically |


      ***


      ## **3. Cookies, Analytics & Third-Party Tools**


      We keep things minimal. We do not use cookies or tracking that identify
      users personally. If we ever use generic analytics (for example, to see
      which pages are most used), it will be:


      * only for improving the experience,

      * completely anonymized,

      * never connected to who you are.


      We don’t embed ad networks or tracking pixels. No third party gets your
      inputs or usage habits in any identifiable form.


      ***


      ## **4. Data Retention & Deletion**


      Since we don’t store personal or identifiable data:


      * There’s nothing to delete that identifies you.

      * All ephemeral data (puzzle input, temporary computation info) is
      discarded after providing answers.

      * If any log files exist, they are purged or rotated regularly to limit
      retention time, and they can’t be used to trace back to you.


      ***


      ## **5. Children & Minors**


      Our tool is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect data from
      children. Since no personal identifying information is collected, we have
      no child-specific data concerns. If you believe we have inadvertently
      collected data tied to a minor, contact us via the email below.


      ***


      ## **6. Changes To This Policy**


      We may update this policy from time to time (for example, to reflect
      improvements or new features). When we do:


      * We’ll revise the “Effective Date” at the top.

      * We’ll publish the updated policy here.

      * If ever a change affects your rights or adds any data collection, it
      will be clearly stated.


      ***


      ## **7. Your Rights & Contact**


      You have the right to:


      * Know that we don’t have personal data about you.

      * See this policy anytime.

      * Ask questions or raise concerns.
